    # Well, lwIP uses global variables for context and loading the library
    # in the usual way would cause different instances to share those global
    # variables.
    #
    # We want to avoid that to be able to simulate different devices in
    # different threads of the same process.
    #
    # So we are left with, at least, two choices:
    # - Using RTLD_PRIVATE (only Linux, not supported by most dlopen
    #   wrappers, cffi is not an exception).
    # - Tricking dlopen into thinking that it's actually loading a different
    #   library each time.
    # It turns out that tricking dlopen is actually quite easy. The only thing
    # needed is for the file to be in a different path. So we are taking this
    # approach:
    #  - Create a named temporary file
    #  - Copy the shared object to the temporary file
    #  - dlopen the temporary file
    #  - And once it's been dlopen'd it's already in memory so we can delete the temporary file
    # It has some caveats, though:
    #  - It requires writing a temporary file
    #  - It loads the same binary in memory several times
    # But since the library is rather small (about 1MB in size) this is no big deal.
